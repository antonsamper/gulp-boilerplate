# Starter boilerplate with gulp.js
A clean and simple opinionated starter boilerplate using gulp.js.

To start using the boilerplate, run `npm i` and `bower i` and the  run one of the tasks.

###### Tasks
* `gulp` (default task)
* `gulp test` (karma only task)


###### Tasks for version bumping
The version bumping tasks should be used before you commit code that will be released and not during development.

* `major-version-bump`
* `minor-version-bump`
* `patch-version-bump`


## Todo
* Implement icon font
* Implement external tasks
* Add different dist for dev e.g. 'dev-dist'
* Add revisions to images on production
* Modify HTML with revision url for images
* Change output folder names e.g. '/images' => '/i' and map files correctly

## Coming Soon
* Upgrade to gulp.js 4.0
* Change `gulp-if` statements so they run on `dev` as opposed to `prod`
